🏰 Conquest of Land
Conquest of Land is an open-source browser-based strategy game inspired by titles like Civilization (CIV) and OpenFront. It blends real-time multiplayer elements with a territorial conquest objective.

🎯 Game Objective
Conquer lands, collect resources (RSS), and battle other players to dominate the map and ultimately seize the castle.

Players can choose different strategies:

Rush to the castle for an early advantage

Build up strength by capturing and upgrading resource-rich territories

Outplay opponents in tactical encounters

🗺️ Gameplay Overview
Players start on the beach (sand terrain) and move inward toward the center.

The castle is located at the center and provides double gold income for its owner.

Each tile of land contains different resource nodes (RSS) such as farms, mines, or gold.

Turns are synchronized: all players act simultaneously with 30 seconds per turn.

Control over land determines your ability to gather, upgrade, and sustain your forces.
